## Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models
<h4>In this repository I've collected all the models and projects that I did during my learning journey From different resources e.g: articles, books, and courses.  
And included them in a well documented jupyter notebooks or python files both of them with README markdown files so that it maybe help someone</h4>
